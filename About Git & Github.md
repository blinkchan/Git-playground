# Introduction
 ## What does Git do?
 What Git does is that it will save all historical versions of every file in your program so that you can access any old version of it with ease.
 ## The difference between Git and Github
 ### What is Git and Github?
 Git is a distributed version-control system, which will check changes in files in any folder that is repository (*This part needs replenishing*). Git will simply save every version of your repository and attach a hash to each, so we can also say that Git is a persistent hash table. The "distributed" word means that there can be multiple people working on the same project. Notice that you can access Git with or without the Internet.
 
 Github on the other hand is a repository hosting service that copies your local repository and makes it accessible on the internet, and even if your while repository on the computer is deleted, it will still be available on Github.

# Installation of Git
